# TraceFlow Deploy Skill

Use this skill to deploy and start `openclaw-traceflow` with the default PM2 production workflow.

## Trigger Phrases

Apply this skill when user intent matches any of:

- "deploy traceflow"
- "start traceflow"
- "restart traceflow"
- "update and start traceflow"
- "deploy openclaw-traceflow"
- "start openclaw monitor"
- "restart openclaw monitor"

Also apply for equivalent Chinese phrasing:

- "部署 traceflow"
- "启动 traceflow"
- "重启 traceflow"
- "更新并启动 traceflow"
- "部署 openclaw-traceflow"
- "启动监控服务"
- "重启监控服务"

## Default Flow (PM2 Production)

1. Locate monorepo and enter `openclaw-traceflow`.
2. Verify dependencies: `node`, `pnpm`, `pm2`.
3. Run `pnpm run deploy:pm2` (runs `pnpm install`, build, then PM2 start/reload).
4. Verify process with `pm2 status openclaw-traceflow`.
5. Print recent logs with `pm2 logs openclaw-traceflow --lines 50 --nostream`.

## Manual Command

From `claw-family` directory:

```bash
./skills/traceflow-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Expected Output (Example)

```text
[traceflow-deploy] Using monorepo root: /path/to/claw-sources
[traceflow-deploy] Running deploy:pm2 (pnpm install + build + PM2)...
[traceflow-deploy] Checking PM2 process status...
[traceflow-deploy] Recent logs (50 lines, no stream)...
[traceflow-deploy] Done.
```

## Troubleshooting

- Missing `pnpm` or `pm2`:
  - Install and re-run:
  - `npm i -g pnpm`
  - `npm i -g pm2`
- Port conflict on `3001`:
  - Check process: `lsof -i :3001`
  - Stop conflicting process, then rerun deploy.
- PM2 process unhealthy:
  - Check details: `pm2 describe openclaw-traceflow`
  - Review logs: `pm2 logs openclaw-traceflow --lines 200 --nostream`

## Notes

- Default behavior is production deployment.
- For local development, use `openclaw-traceflow` project commands directly (`pnpm run start:dev`).
- Canonical user docs: `openclaw-traceflow/README.md` (EN), `openclaw-traceflow/README.zh-CN.md` (中文); implementation notes: `openclaw-traceflow/CLAUDE.md` (defaults: UI **3001**, Gateway **18789**, dashboard poll **~10s** when tab visible).
